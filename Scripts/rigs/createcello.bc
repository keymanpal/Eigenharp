    script to create user cello rig

empty join

#user cello rig un create

# create a user cello rig, you will need to give it a unique name, so change if necessary
# in vi %s/user cello rig/user synth 1 rig/
# this is based on the synth in the Tau configuration
# see link scripts for how to link up to a configuration

# NOTE: the cello needs an impulse to be selected for the convolver, the only way of doing this is via the eigenbrowser
# this script will set the impulse but ONLY if you have the eigenbrowser open

# BTW, yes i know i could use listen, and reduce lines, but I prefer to be explicit & also to be able to run lines without a context

# basic rig creation is
# create rig, and gateway
# create a recorder linked to gateway input
# create a scaler linked to recorder
# possibly create and ahdsr to allow control of vel envelope
# some rigs specific stuff, e.g. oscillators
# create a gain/summer pair, connect it to last agent in rig specific stuff
# create an fx audio unit to allow specific vst/au effects on the rig, connect it to summer
# create output of fx audio unit back to rig gateway ouput

# first create the rig, and all the outputs/inputs, this is basically the same for all rigs
