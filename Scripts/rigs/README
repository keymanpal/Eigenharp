in this directory you will find a number of instrument rigs for use with EigenD, all ae based on the Tau rigs unless specified otherwise

The create scripts just create the rigs, they do NOT wire them up into a setup, as this will be different depending upon the setup they are going to be loaded into
them
the link script is very much a sample to show what is needed to be connected, basically keygroup, and mixer - one for pico, pico mix and tau ... im sure someone will add alpha :)

notes:
- the sample oscillator are never preloaded with samples, they are deliberatly left blank, so you will need to set using belcanto, or workbench or stage
- the audio units  are never preloaded with plugins, they are deliberatly left blank, so you will need to set using belcanto, or workbench or stage
- all rigs are default names user X rig , eg. user synth rig, so as not to clash with factory ones, you can rename see comment in rig file
- all belcanto files have .bc suffic, so that editors can determine file type

files:
createsynth.bc	-  simple synth based on sawtooth oscillator, as provided in alpha and tau setups
createaudiounit.bc - rig for housing audio unit and vst instruments
createsimplesampler.bc - rig for playing samples
createdoublesampler.bc - rig for which play 2 different samples of left and right pan, based on yaw of key
createpanpipe.bc - a panpipe rig, created by Antonio based on STK	
createclarinet.bc - clarinet rig, note does NOT have stringer, as its incompatible with fingerer
createcello.bc - cello rig, note does NOT have stringer, as its incompatible with fingerer, have browser open to select impulse
createmidi.bc - midi rig, note , need to use specific link script below

createsax.bc - sax rig - WILL NOT WORK, frequency is misspelt by eigenlabs, you must in workbench alter this, for the rest of the script to work

picomixlinksynthrig.bc - sample script, which shows how to link a newly created synth rig into pico mix setup
picolinksynthrig.bc - sample script, which shows how to link a newly created synth rig into pico factory setup
taulinksynthrig.bc - sample script, which shows how to link a newly created synth rig into tau factory setup

picomixlinkmidirig.bc - sample script, which shows how to link a newly created midi rig into pico mix setup, this is different due to midi output needed in main rig


createloooper.bc - looper rig, designed to hold a loop recorder like mobius, associated link script is provided to show how to link it up
